Welcome to Digital Tools for Research, a Griffith [RED](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-services/researcher-education-development) workshop.

This workshop has five sections, reflecting the phases of research outlined by [Kramer](https://twitter.com/MsPhelps) and [Bosnan](https://twitter.com/jeroenbosman) of Utrecht University in their [extensive 2016 study](https://101innovations.wordpress.com) on scholarly tools (Kramer and Bosnan actually use seven phases, but we have simplified it to five).
